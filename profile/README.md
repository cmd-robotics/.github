Welcome to the **cmd-robotics** org!

Here's a general plan for current and future git projects:

* wherever possible, the repo name should immediately inform the user about its contents and its relationship/location within the whole product
* should be short and readable
* should NOT contain version numbers and/or codenames (use branches and tags within repos)
* should avoid using codenames for parts of the project wherever a short description for the part exists (i.e. prefer "comms" over "hermes")
* list of suggested content prefixes and suffixes (please feel free to add to the list):
  * web -- user-facing web pages and immediate services associated with them
  * cloud/cld -- cloud (web-) services
  * app/apps -- apps running on iOS and Android
  * sw -- usermode applications running on a non-phone/table platforms
  * fw -- software running on bare metal or equivalent
  * hw -- electronics: schematics and PCBs
  * mech -- mechanical parts and assemblies
